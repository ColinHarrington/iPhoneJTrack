iPhone consolidated.db to kml
=============

Java utility to take a consolidated.db file from an iPhone and convert the data to KML

The original tool opened up a backup file on the iPhone, but this tool is to be used if you already have the file.
On a jailbroken iPhone the file should be located at `/private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/consolidated.db`
